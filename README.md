### Author's Note

> After submitting 13 reports to MSRC and receiving a range of responses—from 'bypassing Defender is not a servicing boundary' to vulnerabilities being designated as 'won't fix' (effectively acknowledging the issue)—I decided to create this blog and research hub. My purpose is to share all of my security knowledge, with the hope of helping to elevate the community's collective expertise.

## Report Abstract

This comprehensive security report investigates unpatchable vulnerabilities in Windows 10 and 11, focusing on systemic flaws that resist traditional patching due to their deep integration into the operating system’s architecture, hardware dependencies, and legacy compatibility requirements. These vulnerabilities, rooted in fundamental design choices and ecosystem constraints, pose significant challenges to securing millions of Windows devices worldwide.

The report examines three critical vulnerabilities: legacy BIOS/UEFI firmware weaknesses, kernel memory management flaws, and backward compatibility with legacy protocols. It provides a detailed technical analysis, exploitation vectors, detection challenges, and comprehensive mitigation strategies. With Windows 10 approaching its end-of-support deadline in October 2025, these flaws pose heightened risks, necessitating proactive defenses.

This report adheres to responsible disclosure principles and aims to support Microsoft’s efforts to strengthen Windows security in 2025.

### Key Vulnerabilities Investigated

* **Legacy BIOS/UEFI Firmware Weaknesses:** Persistent threats that survive OS reinstalls by embedding in firmware.
* **Kernel Memory Management Flaws:** Systemic issues in components like CLFS and MMIO that allow for privilege escalation and EDR evasion.
* **Backward Compatibility with Legacy Protocols:** Inherent risks from supporting outdated protocols like SMBv1 and NetBIOS in enterprise environments.
